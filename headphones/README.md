This project is focused on applying **HTML**, **CSS**, **Accessibility**, and **Responsive Design** skills to replicate a given Figma design.

 Objective

To Recreate a landing page design using only HTML and CSS. The layout, styles, and responsiveness should match the original Figma file as closely as possible, without the use of any external frameworks.

Interactions and Design Notes

- The page must be **responsive**, switching to a mobile layout when the screen width is **480px or less**.
- **Link hover/active state** color: `#FF6565`
- **Button hover/active state**: `opacity: 0.9`
- Maximum content width: `1000px`, centered horizontally on the page.
